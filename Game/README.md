# The Game Files Directory

*Please include this header and that license for any derivative works.*

*NOTE: Only the documentation, tools and anything that's not directly a part of the game's data fall under this copyright. I don't claim any ownership of the game or any of its assets*

## Warning:

Do not commit any game files themselves to git if contributing. This directory gets ignored in the .gitignore file and any game files uploaded could get this project shutdown. Thanks

## How to Use This Directory

* Rip the game from disc using your preferred methods (will not give instructions on that)

* Use 7-Zip to extract all of the game's files to this directory (must be exactly how it is on the disc); 7-Zip doesn't change permissions or do any modifications to the files that some other extraction tools can do, so it's usually one of the safest options
  
  * Files in this directory should look like this:
    
    * PSP_GAME
    
    * UMD_DATA.BIN
