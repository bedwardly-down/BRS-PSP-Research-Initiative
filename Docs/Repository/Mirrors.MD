This documentation is for a feature primarily intended as a fail safe. For the time being, the Github repository will be the canonical main repository. This list contains alternative services that will be available and kept in sync with the main repository in case something happens that takes it down. Pull requests, issue tracking, discussions, etc, will not be available on them unless they are needed as the new main repository. The main goal of having multiple mirrored locations is to future proof the documentation and tools provided here.
