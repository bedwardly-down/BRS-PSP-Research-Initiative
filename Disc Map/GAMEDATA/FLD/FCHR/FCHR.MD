# FCHR.BIN Data Structures

This document is separate from the individual FCHR files because there's a specific structure to the entire section (that I will refer to as Namespaces from here on out).

## Namespaces

* FCHR_B - Bosses

* FCHR_G - Gimmicks/Gizmos/Game Objects - It's a grab bag of multiple types of models that are mostly interacted with by the player but aren't enemies

* FCHR_M - Mobs - All of the non-boss enemies the player fights

* FCHR_P - Playable Characters (see SCPM in FileFormats.md doc for notes on a possible second character found)

* FCHR_S - Skills

* FCHR_W - Weapons
