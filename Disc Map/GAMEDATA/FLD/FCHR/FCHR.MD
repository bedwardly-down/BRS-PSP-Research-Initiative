# FCHR.BIN Data Structures

* NOTE: All of the files here are SC (Stacked Container) types related to a variety of different game assets. Until we figure out what exactly FLD and FCHR stand for, I won't be fully documenting this section. All of these were contained within GZip compressed BIN files within `GAMEDATA\FLD\FCHR` on the game disc.
