# IF (Interface) Data Structures

* NOTE: The directories below here primarily contain LPK files or PTMD files (in the case of PICT). Will document more once I figure out how PTMDs are structured. The LPKs here also have quite a bit of structure to them compared to the other ones with the possibility of several having unique file types that no other parts of the game have.
