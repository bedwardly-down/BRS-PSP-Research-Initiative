Use these files to extract data from the game's ROM. These are subject to change and some may be usable for other games.

* BRS-Vol.bms - run this on files with the VOL extension. It should extract them without issues.

* BRS-Xor.bms - many files inside of archives will be encrypted. Run this on those files to see which XOR encryption was used. This one is going to possibly change quite a bit as more keys are found.

* BRS-Lpk.bms - run this on LPK files (if they're encrypted, you may need to decrypt them first before they extract)
