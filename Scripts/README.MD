Use these files to extract data from the game's ROM. These are subject to change and some may be usable for other games.

* BRS-Extract - New script for extracting files. BRS-Vol.bms and BRS-Lpk.bms are no longer needed. BRS-Xor.bms will still be needed for decryption of some files.

* BRS-Xor.bms - many files inside of archives will be encrypted. Run this on those files to see which XOR encryption was used. This one is going to possibly change quite a bit as more keys are found.
