This repository will host my findings and various scripts, tools and documentation I've put together from diving into [Black Rock Shooter: The Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328084959/http://brs.jrpg.jp/) for the Playstation Portable handheld console. It's a work in progress and contributions are welcomed. All that I ask is that any projects that use anything from this repository will link back here and not claim ownership of anything within.

=====================================================================
## Recommended Tools

* [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) - for running any scripts labeled with the `.bms` extension.

* [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org) - for reading the game memory

* [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) - for playing the game (although, any PSP emulator or even the real hardware with proper tools should work)

* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) - for reading the binaries and figuring out the structures of the game's internal workings

* [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - for extracting data from Gzip compressed binary files and GZ extension files

* [Offzip](https://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz/offzip.zip) - for extracting data from ZZZ archives (haven't found an alternative way for these yet)

* [Vgmstream-cli](https://github.com/vgmstream/vgmstream) - for converting at3 files into a user playable format

=====================================================================
## Current TODO

- [ ] Automate and document the full extraction process

- [ ] Document the full disc structure

- [ ] Set up tools for rebuilding the data structure for use in game
