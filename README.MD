This repository will host my findings and various scripts, tools and documentation I've put together from my findings for [Black Rock Shooter: The Game](https://web.archive.org/web/20150328084959/http://brs.jrpg.jp/) for the Playstation Portable handheld console. It's a work in progress and contributions are welcomed. All that I ask is that any projects that use anything from this repository will link back here and not claim ownership of anything within. See the respective file headers for anything specific.

## Recommended Tools

* [QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/quickbms.htm) - for running any scripts labeled with the `.bms` extension.

* [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org) - for reading the game memory

* [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/) - for playing the game (although, any PSP emulator or even the real hardware with proper tools should work)

* Any kind of Hex Editor - for reading the binaries and figuring out the structures of the game's internal workings.
